# About This Site

Hi 👋, my name is **Kartikeya Sharma**.

I run a YouTube channel called **@savagecarol**, where I share content and tutorials.

I created this website so that everyone can **learn and study System Design** in a simple and practical way.

The goal of this site is to make system design concepts:

- Easy to understand
- Practical for interviews and real-world systems
- Accessible to everyone

If you find this useful, feel free to check out my YouTube channel and share this site with others. 🚀

Happy learning!
